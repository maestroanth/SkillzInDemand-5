Compared to Sequence Diagrams (which focus on the order of interactions)

Communication Diagrams show links between participants. (Can be Diagonal)

1.1 (Participant #1 and which message )
2.3 (Participant # 2 message 3)

Nested Methods are a little different. Only shows One time interaction

Parrallel Methods are a little different, add letter to number 1a.1 or 2b.3

Always draw in a link (w/o arrow) and then an arrow to whoever is sending and receiving
