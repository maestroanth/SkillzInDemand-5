Jargon:

Initial Node which is a filled in circle.

Incoming Edge: arrow coming into an action

Action: In rounded rectonagle

Outcoming Edge: arrow coming out and action

Merge: combined edges that are separated by a decision (diamond symbol) [authorized vs. not authorized]

Merge Action: Actions take on a merge

Merge point: combined edges are merged back together into a single (diamond symbol)

Fork: Merge actions that need to be verified at same time.

UML Let is free he recommends.

Time Event: (shaped like hourglass) can be used as an initial node with with a duration. I.e. repeating node evey 30 seconds call activity node

Dotted Line: Can bring out an action in more detail in it's own box

Interruption Region: demonstrates an activity that can end without finishing the event (required use of lightning shape arrow)

Object Node: Regular (non-rounded) rectangle common to attach a note to explain

Flow final node: Circle with an X in it. Repeated annoying action that is undetermined.

Partition: Passes task to another

Object Output/Input Pin: object is being transfered demonstrated as little boxes with arrows
<<tranformation>> order.items

Signals: Funny shape rectangle with one side as a point. Send Signal and Receive Signal (fits in puzzle piece)

Received Signals can start as an initial node.

Connectors: You run out of space, put a circle with a C in it to continue the activity node to next line

Expansion Region: Dotted region that represents a group of actions that need to be taken on group of objects
