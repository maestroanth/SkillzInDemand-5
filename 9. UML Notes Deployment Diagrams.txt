Use Deployment Diagrams to show how hardware and software work together.

<<device>> are hardware nodes in 3D boxes

Node Stereotypes

<<executionEnvironment>> JSP Server {Tomcat 7}

<<database system>> MySQL 5.5, you can use it in a 3D cylinder shape

Named Nodes

<<device>>
cardVerify:server

<<device>>
fundsVerify:server

Node Communication Lines

Draw a line of communication <<protocol>>TCP/IP

Nodes can be within each other I.e. Database is in Device

Artifacts

Software is Artifacts .txt, .exes. config etc

2D sheet of paper with a little note pic
<<artifact>> atm.jar

Tie artifacts to nodes with dependency arrows ---> to <<device>>

or list artifacts within node itself

Artifacts & Components

<<manifest>> to <<component>>cardReader Components define the requirements to operate artifacts

Deployment Specifications

Guys that stand between your code and the execution node or device node

<<executionEnvironment>> look like an artifact node

Specification Deployment Diagram
	Includes all the different devices like an ATM has a keypad printer, money grabber, etc.
