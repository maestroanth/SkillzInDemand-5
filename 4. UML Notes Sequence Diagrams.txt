Jargon:

Sequence Diagrams Models interactions in your program, and show order of interactions

Which interactions are triggered and when

Participants (sometimes across the top) - can be objects or parts of system. Objects name and class type. theCustomer:Customer, except for anonymous listeners (action listeners)

Lifeline: ------- (time going down)

Message Arrow -> Passes Message signature. Filled in arrow means synchronous message, they wait for reply in between each.

Non-filled Arrow -> Asyncronous, not wait for reply.

<<create>> another participant can occur

<<delete>> big X participant is destroyed

Bunch of types of Sequence Fragments

Sequence Fragment (pinEnteredWrong >=3] Guard Condition Parameter

Negative Sequence Fragments

Reference Sequence Fragments (used to separate complex interactions in sequence diagrams)

Loop Sequence Fragment loop(amt<=balance) until Guard Condition comes back as false or define min and max or 5 times

Parallel Sequence Fragment Interactions can be in Parallel.

Defining Time COnstraints call(>10ms) reply (>5ms)

Dfine Lost Message: ---->O
Defines Found Message: O----> (circles filled in)

Assert Sequence Fragment

Break Sequence Fragment (with break condition out of loop)

Critical Sequence Fragment Lock out Operations

Nested Messages: one message cause the receiving participant to send or receive other messages.
