Making Timing Diagrams: Find the States (i.e. from Use Case Description)

Find the Participants (i.e. Actors or System Parts)

Match States to Participants

Customer
	Card in Hand

	Put in Card

Card Reader
	
	No Card
	Holding Card
Bank System
	Account Valid
	Amount Valid


Put States in Order (they should correlate and match i.e. if customer has card in hand then card reader and bank system has no card

Count is in T (whatever units) along an X axis

Graph how long each state and event takes among each participant.

Only use participants with major interactions in timing diagram

Arrows to show triggered events
