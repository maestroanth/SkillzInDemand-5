State Machine and Package Diagrams

State Machine Diagrams Model the changing states of objects and events that cause these changes

Transition Arrows ---> between rounded corner boxes

Events are written across transition arrows trigger state changes

May be listed in tables:

State/Trigger  Card Entered  Eject Card
No Card		Has Card	-
Has Card	   -		No Card

Normally have initial state and final state.

Document behaviors that occur when you are in a state.

Initial state <-(loop)->Request funds -> List a trigger, guard, transitional behavior. -> Process Request -> Final State
